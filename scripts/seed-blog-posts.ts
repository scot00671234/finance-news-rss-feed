Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

### Key Characteristics

1. **Decentralization**: No single point of control
2. **Immutability**: Records cannot be altered
3. **Transparency**: All participants can verify transactions
4. **Security**: Cryptographic protection
5. **Consensus**: Agreement mechanism for validation

## How Blockchain Works

### Basic Structure

#### 1. Blocks
- **Block Header**: Contains metadata and hash
- **Transaction Data**: The actual information stored
- **Previous Hash**: Links to the previous block
- **Timestamp**: When the block was created

#### 2. Hash Functions
- **Purpose**: Create unique fingerprints for data
- **Properties**: One-way, deterministic, avalanche effect
- **Examples**: SHA-256, Keccak-256
- **Security**: Extremely difficult to reverse

#### 3. Merkle Trees
- **Structure**: Hierarchical data organization
- **Purpose**: Efficient verification of transactions
- **Benefits**: Reduced storage requirements
- **Verification**: Quick transaction validation

### Consensus Mechanisms

#### 1. Proof of Work (PoW)

**How It Works**:
- Miners compete to solve complex puzzles
- First to solve gets to add the next block
- Requires significant computational power
- Energy-intensive but secure

**Examples**: Bitcoin, Ethereum (pre-Merge)
**Advantages**: High security, battle-tested
**Disadvantages**: High energy consumption, slow

#### 2. Proof of Stake (PoS)

**How It Works**:
- Validators are chosen based on stake
- Higher stake = higher chance of selection
- Less energy-intensive than PoW
- Economic incentives for good behavior

**Examples**: Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Polkadot
**Advantages**: Energy efficient, scalable
**Disadvantages**: Potential centralization, complexity

#### 3. Other Consensus Mechanisms

**Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**:
- Token holders vote for delegates
- Delegates validate transactions
- Fast and efficient
- Examples: EOS, Tron

**Proof of Authority (PoA)**:
